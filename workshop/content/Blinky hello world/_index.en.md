Learn how to create a cloud connected "blinky" (the [hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) for microcontrollers) application with your M5Stack Core2 for AWS IoT EduKit reference hardware. Using your own AWS account, you'll walk-through how to connect your device to [AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/), send and receive [MQTT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/mqtt.html) messages, and view the messages on both the device and in AWS cloud. All of the steps and skills used here will provide the foundation to be successful in subsequent tutorials. Specifically, you will:
- Install and configure the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) on your host machine to remotely manage your AWS services and use provided helper scripts.
- Register a "[thing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-thing-management.html)" in AWS IoT Core using the security certificates pre-provisioned on the onboard secure element.
- Configure your reference hardware to connect to Wi-Fi, connect to your account's [AWS IoT endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html), and send MQTT messages to AWS IoT Core.
- Receive an MQTT message from the cloud on the specified reference hardware to trigger blinking an LED. 
 
All the content in this tutorial assumes you presently have the [M5Stack Core2 ESP32 IoT Development Kit for AWS IoT EduKit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/) in your possession, an [AWS account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) that is *not* running production workloads, have your [environment setup](getting-started/prerequisites.html) from the Getting Started tutorial, and are comfortable with basic technical concepts and toolsâ€”such as the command prompt/terminal. To purchase your own kit, check out [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/), the [M5Stack store](https://m5stack.com/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit) or their global distributors. If you haven't registered for an AWS account yet, please [create an account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).
